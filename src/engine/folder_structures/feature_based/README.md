# Feature-based Structure

This structure groups all related files for a given feature into a single directory. This arrangement is particularly beneficial for larger applications where there are numerous interconnected components. By bundling everything related to a specific feature together, it becomes more straightforward to locate and understand the interplay of files and their functions.

## Pros:

- **Scalability**: The structure scales well as the application grows. New features can be added as new directories, encapsulating all the related components and logic.
  
- **Maintainability**: With all files related to a feature co-located, it becomes easier to understand, modify, and debug the code for that feature.
  
- **Team Collaboration**: Different teams or individuals can work on separate features without much interference, as each feature has its dedicated directory.
  
## Cons:

- **Initial Overhead**: For smaller projects, a feature-based structure might feel like overkill, introducing unnecessary complexity.
  
- **Potential for Duplication**: Shared utilities and components can sometimes be replicated across features, which might necessitate a shared or common directory to avoid duplication.

## Recommended Use Cases
Web applications, projects where features are distinct.

## Real Companies Using It
Facebook (for some of its features), Slack.

## `bin` and `lib` directories

### `bin` directory:

The `bin` directory traditionally contains executable scripts. In many Node.js CLI applications or service applications, this is where you might find the main entry point of the application.

- **Purpose**: 
  - Houses the primary executable file/script that kicks off the application when it's run from the command line or when the service is started.
  
- **Usage**: 
  - When creating a package that can be installed globally using `npm`, the executable specified in the package's `bin` field (inside `package.json`) often resides here. For a service or server, this is where the script that starts the server (like initializing configurations, setting up connections) might be located.
  
- **Example**: 
  - In our provided structure, `start.ts` might contain code to initialize the application or service, handling setup tasks such as connecting to a database or starting an HTTP server.

### `lib` directory:

The `lib` directory traditionally contains reusable libraries or utilities. These aren't directly related to the primary business logic or features but are used across them.

- **Purpose**: 
  - For utility functions, shared libraries, or other pieces of code that aren't tied to a specific feature or domain of the application but can be shared across multiple parts.
  
- **Usage**: 
  - Often contains helper functions, shared middleware, shared configurations, or other shared utility classes/functions.
  
- **Example**: 
  - In the provided structure, `helper.ts` might contain utility functions for tasks like date formatting, data sanitization, etc. `validators.ts` could have shared validation logic or utility functions.

In the context of our provided structure, these directories help compartmentalize and organize the application. However, it's not a strict rule to have a `bin` or `lib` directory; their inclusion depends on the specific needs of the project. Notably, many projects might not include a `bin` directory if they're not meant to be command-line tools.

As per Google's TypeScript style guide's "organize-by-feature" principle, utilities specific to a feature could reside within that feature's directory. General utilities used across features might still belong in the `lib` directory to prevent duplication.
